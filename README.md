RPM Package for the Intel GNA library 
=====================================

This is (the code for an RPM package of) the userspace component of the Intel GNA driver for Linux. A [kernel module](https://github.com/xanderlent/intel-gna-kmod) is also required to use the Intel GNA hardware.

See the [upstream intel/gna repository](https://github.com/intel/gna) for more information about the hardware and software.

All patches to the sources are generated from [the fix-fedora-build branch of my downstream fork xanderlent/gna](https://github.com/xanderlent/gna/tree/fix-fedora-build).
